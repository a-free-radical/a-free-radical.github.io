I'm sitting on CZ couch this last night in Blacksburg. Tomorrow CZ and I drive to NYC. I will be meeting friends and visiting for the weekend then catch a train to Atlanta on Tuesday.

I did some accounting today and found that I've spent about $2,000 on gear, plane/train/bus tickets, and food/drinks over the past month and a half. Not a frugal start, but I've been moving around quite a bit and have been under certain obligations to be places on time, limiting the type of travel I can choose from.

As I prepare to leave I'm taking account of what I've accomplished down here. I connected with Ray and got quite a bit done on the Phenological Clock project. I fell a great many invasive trees at Crow Forest Farm and helped dig holes and move earth for their budding garden. I've gotten started with my Kairos project, a YouTube channel where I will do live interviews. I've also gotten some other projects in order and tied up some loose ends. Most of all I decompressed from the city.

Didn't do a drawing today, but I think I'll expand my goal of a drawing a day to simply something creative a day. Today I worked on the Kairos logo. Max send me an illustration for the faces and I've come up with this:

Here you can see detail of Max's illustration.

I'm using gradient mesh in Illustrator for the rainbow effect.
