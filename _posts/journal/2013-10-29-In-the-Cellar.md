Sitting in the Cellar listening to jazz over rum and pizza.

CZ's new lover plays the upright base. she glows while she watches. she is quite happy here. last time I was with her she was beaten down by the cold bitch that is new your city. now life is full and rich for her. it excites me just being around such happieness.

I met the artist ray K. over the weekend. he and a small army of locals who were helping him move paintings over to a new storage location on his property.

I told him about the clock project and he sees a possibility for collaboratuion. I will introduce him to nat soon. CZ also introduced me to her project farm book. the Facebook for farmers. normally I am quite sceptical about anything that is the Facebook for anything but this seems very promising. she has a fairly well mapped out plan for it and she can go to VT for funding. her work ties into the clock and into things I worked on in occupy.

I am thinking about building a tiny house up here in February and using this as my first work stop. I could stay Feb to May. four solid months, after January in NYC. this could all work out.

## a sense of fear

washed over me the other day. I've still got a bit of work from my past life itching at me. I feel like I'm not doing enough. a familiar feeling.

after going to ray's I went out with dan and grace. a local couple who took me out to some of their old highschool friends. they watched internet and drank. maybe I'm too hard on myself. is it wrong to do not much? I feel lost, but isn't that the point. I'm a vagabond now, the traveler. don't I get to  do nothing?

it passes and I march on.
