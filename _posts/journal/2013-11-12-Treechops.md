I am a mighty force. Thousands of years I have studied the nature of how things break. First by feel, now with instruments. The steel on the business end of the ax has been perfected from the very first wedge held in human like hands some 10,000 years ago.

This marvel was used to fall a [Tree of Heaven](treeofheaven) grove.

> There's a tree that grows in Brooklyn. Some people call it the Tree of Heaven. No matter where its seed falls, it makes a tree which struggles to reach the sky. It grows in boarded up lots and out of neglected rubbish heaps. It grows up out of cellar gratings. It is the only tree that grows out of cement. It grows lushly...survives without sun, water, and seemingly earth. It would be considered beautiful except that there are too many of it.

We are building fires around the stumps to try and destroy the roots. Seems we picked a bad time to do the cutting. Ailanthus Altissima is invasive in this area (as I'm told). Trees have the most energy saved up for winter these days, so they are stronger, and have extra energy to produce new shoots and roots when cut.

I went into town to meet Jen today. She is working on a hacker space here in Blacksburg, they have the incorporation down, now just waiting for the space. I'll see if there is more to this...

## Dancing

In an effort to do things that make me uncomfortable I went to Salsa Dance lessons today. The beginner class was great, it was the basic class (or advanced if you were me) which made me uncomfortable. I'm not good about doing things I'm bad at. I don't like being bad at things, which you have to do with anything you eventually get sort of good at... so it's a problem.

I was also able to get the RSS syndication on this blog working, which is great. You can see it at {{ site.production_url }}rss.xml

I've also started drawing a picture a day, here is todays:
