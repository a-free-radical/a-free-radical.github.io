I'm on a bench outside Duarte Square. Behind me a large temporary building hosts "talking transition", discussions around the changing politics of NYC, with it's liberal incoming mayor.

Two years ago, almost to the day, I was here for a different "discussion" of transition. Duarte square was empty, encased by high chain link fence. The recently evicted Occupy activists were staging a hostile takeover of the space, owned by Trinity Church. The highly symbolic act of erecting a stair case over the fence to allow access to a handful of brave souls failed to take the space. Instead scared that little bit of history upon the place.

I drove up to NYC with CZ. On our ride we listened to a radio interview with a prolific preacher of The Law of Attraction. The intro asked me, the listener, if I were depressed, scared, anxious, unhappy with where my life was going. For maybe the first time ever I honestly considered the question.

"No" I silently answered back. I holster none of those undesirable emotions. I am unburdened.

On Saturday I went to a fund raiser for the Cargo Bike Collective, an anarchistic cooperative with a small fleet of cargo bikes. The event was at a cooperative house in Bedsty, where I was staying. As I stood in the backyard looking over the crowd of nonconformists I was struck by the beauty of the scene. An MC was standing above the crowd on a brick stove containing the fire. Casting tall shadows on the apartments beyond the back fence.

The MC was reading off raffle ticket prizes which included free cargo bike services, vegan pies, and dumpster diving lessons. When he reached the drawing for a free month of compost collection he asked "who here composts?" a great many hands and cheers went up.

Things are changing, again. I looked at this crowd, this tribe in Brooklyn. More than ever I saw the potential for them to really support each other. Maybe things will be all right? Of course a life style choice, be it composting, short showers, or saving food from the waste stream are not an end but a beginning.

It reminds me of that protest sign, simple text painted on cardboard: "The beginning is near".

And it is, knocking on the door.

How many tribes are out there? I must know of at least 10 in Brooklyn alone, interwoven through activism, parties, and life style. Hidden in plain sight. Invisible to even some of it's members and more so to those still within the system, still under the oppression of the machine. It's like the first western settlers to the new world who looked upon the forests and native people and though "look at all this unused land, the savages know not what profit and abundance they could have" while all the while blind to the highly nurtured and cultivated landscape that was actually before their eyes. We don't yet remember a method for quantifying these things.

Upstairs I sat cramped in a room strobing with red, white, and blue lights which reacted to network traffic passing through the wifi in the house while a crusty punk band played their music.

Here I am in the cyberpunk future struggling to becoming human again.
