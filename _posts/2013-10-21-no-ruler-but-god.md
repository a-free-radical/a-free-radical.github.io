Sitting on CZ's couch with good food in my stomach and a nip of burbon in my cup.

We purchased a cot for an out building on the property. I'll be sleeping in here in exchange for some sweat equity (as well as techquity, more on that later). There are some bikes on the property that we will fix up so I can get around town.

Blacksburg is a really swell place so far as I know. The barber today told me there is nothing to do for fun here, though she might have been a little bit cynical (or maybe hard to please). I wandered a bit around and found an interesting ally with some [high art](http://www.banksy.co.uk/). Among the artists work was a tag, probably a single person, with an [anarchy &#9398;][anarchy] over the [Omega &Omega;][omega]. Though I know not the intended meaning, one interpretation I found is that of a Christian sect (in summery): There is no ruler but god and only god rules over you.

There is also the verse from [Book of Revelation 1:8, 21:6, and 22:13][verse]:

> "I am the Alpha and the Qmega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End"

I tend to see god and physics as one in the same, so I like that description. Though we find ourselves in a world where many claim to be rulers, ultimately we are all subject to the rule of the physical world. No matter how rich and clever, no one can escape that truth. In the end chains will rust and all things will crumble to dust against the long arm of the physical world.

Before that happens, people will make art on walls. Here's some of the images I found.

I really liked the Mario scene:

You can find it here:

I also bought new shoes, the $20 airwalks weren't cutting it. I needed something I could tool around town in and hike in.

Off to my barn bedroom, and much more to come.
