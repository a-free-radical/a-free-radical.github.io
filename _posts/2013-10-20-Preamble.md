I'm moving south towards Knoxville on I-75. Packed into the back of of the car with my Mother and Father. Driving is my sister and her husband sits shotgun. We snack on processed sugary treats.

I met the family a few days ago in Louisville Kentucky. We've been staying at an old southern bed and breakfast across the street from Central Park Louisville. The digs were lovely and opulent. The family spent the weekend touring Bourbon distilleries and drinking bourbon.

It's been wonderful seeing these far flung family members together and I appreciate the comfort afforded to me on this short trip. Drinking fine spirits and eating good meals with people I love.

When I arrive in Knoxville I will be parting ways with my family for now and boarding a bus to Blacksburg Virginia where I will meet CZ at [Crow Forest Farm][crowforest].

## How I got here

I have been houseless in Brooklyn since October 1st. I made a rash decision to leave my wonderful Crown Heights apartment just over a month ago. Travel has been something I've wanted to do for a long time. I've day dreamed about leaving town and setting off on adventure for many years. I guess at a certain point you either just do it or don't. I did.

The first part of October was spent couch surfing in Brooklyn, tying up loose ends, consolidating my apartment full of things into a backpack full of things.

On October 15th I flew out of NYC to Indianapolis for a brief visit with my Aunt B. I joined her and my Uncle for a ride down to Louisville where we met the rest of the family.

## Where I'm going

I would consider this leg of my journey to be the forward. Mel is getting married on May 4th, 2014 so I have obligations to stay near NYC till then. I'll be staying on Crow Hill Farm for a few weeks until I head back to Atlanta to spend some time with the mother and father. From there, we'll see where I end up.

Much more to come.
