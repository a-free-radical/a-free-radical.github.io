I'm sitting in CZ's kitchen sipping on tea. There is a smokey smell coming from the wood burning stove and the dew sparkles on the flora outside.

Yesterday the bus from Knoxville was an hour late and would have put me in Roanoke - an hour's drive from my final destination - at about 2:20 am. I coordinated with CZ and she agreed to brave the highway and pick me up, no matter what the time. At the next stop I spoke with the bus driver about dropping me off at an earlier point on the road, where I passed much closer to my destination. She said that the bus used to stop there, but didn't anymore. There was nothing I or she could do it would seem.

Fast forward a few hours into the trip. At another rest stop the driver calls me over.

> "Are you the only one getting off?"
> "Yes"
> "Do you have a bag under the bus?"
> "Yeah"
> "Pull it out and sit up front with me"

The driver drops me off at a rest stop about 15 minutes from Blacksburg where CZ and a friend of her's pull in and pick me up.

As I get off the bus in a sleepy daze I ask if the driver has a card or number so I can write to Greyhound and let them know how awesome she is. She simply says "do something nice for someone else" and closes the door.

When we arrive at [Crow Forest Farm][crowforest] it's well past 1am. CZ asks if I'm hungry, which I was, and proceeds to make *from scratch* egg noodles and reheat some chicken soup. We quickly eat and go to sleep.

I look forward to my time here.
